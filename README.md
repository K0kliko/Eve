# Eve
Batch script to put your PC to sleep

-Before launching Eve.bat read this
-Launch Eve.bat press a key to say that you are sure to put your PC to sleep and it will go to sleep

-Some line from the creator

Thank you a thousand times for using my project because it is my first code and I had thought it for people with a background screen with boxes or if you manage to put your pc to sleep
Otherwise it's my first code and I hope my code will be useful to you ! <3
